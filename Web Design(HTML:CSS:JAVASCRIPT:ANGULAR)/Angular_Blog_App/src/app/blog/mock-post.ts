        p:"In recent weeks, President Trump and Pyongyang have escalated their war of words over North Korea's nuclear weapons testing, with both sides hinting it could end with a nuclear conflict.But while the rhetoric has focused on North Korea, the Central Intelligence Agency is just as worried about China. CIA analysts say the North Korean tests have heightened the concerns the U.S. has about managing the rise of China, which sees the conflict as a way of keeping the U.S. off-balance in Asia while maintaining its influence over its immediate neighbors.“It is, to us, not just an immediate national security threat,” the CIA’s Michael Collins, deputy assistant director for East Asia Mission Center, said last week at a national security conference at George Washington University. “It is forcing us to think about the long-term management of China.”"

        p:"Where did this story come from? How did you come up with the idea to have a fugitive billionaire propel the action?I wanted to write a detective story about a detective whose brain disorder is unhelpful. Because there's so many detective stories about obsessive people who are brilliant detectives because of their obsessiveness and my experience with obsessiveness has been more or less the complete opposite. I wanted to write a detective story where the plot keeps getting interrupted by this person's inability to live in the world in the way that she wants to. And then I needed some big, somewhat fantastical mystery. I also wanted to write about the ways that different kinds of privilege intersect in people's lives and the ways that they blind you."
