                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
                ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                 and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived 
                 not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                  the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced 
                below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de 
                Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their 
                exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
                translation by H. Rackham.

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
                readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of 
                using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
                letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 
                look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web 
                page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a 
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their 
                infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by 
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
                at Hampden-Sydney <sub>College</sub> in Virginia, looked up one of the 
                more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem <sup>passage</sup>, 
                and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the 
                undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 
                of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by 
                Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of 
                ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem 
                Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 
                1.10.32.

                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but 
                the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, 
                or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.

                    If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be 
                    sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
                    ll the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined 
                    chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the 
                    Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with 
                    a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which 
                    looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free 
                    from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
